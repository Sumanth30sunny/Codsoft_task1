The program generates a random number between 1 and 100. 
The player has to guess the correct number within 5 chances for each round. 
After each guess, the program tells the player if their guess is too low, too high, or correct. If the player guesses correctly, they pass the round and move to the next one.
The player's score is the number of rounds they successfully complete.
After each round, the program asks if the player wants to play again.
The game continues until the player decides not to play anymore.
